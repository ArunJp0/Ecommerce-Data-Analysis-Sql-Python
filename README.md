# Ecommerce Data Analysis Using SQL & Python

- This project focuses on analyzing an ecommerce dataset (Kaggle) by performing SQL-based data exploration and visualizations using Python. The analysis helps identify customer behavior, sales trends,
  and operational insights across multiple dimensions such as customer location, product category, order values, and revenue distribution.

# Project Overview
  - Used Python to import and dump the dataset into a MySQL database.
  - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL queries and Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib).
  - Cleaned data by identifying and handling duplicate records in key transactional tables like order_items and payments.
  - Applied joins, aggregations, window functions, and filtering techniques to derive insights.

# Key Analysis Performed
  Customer Distribution:
  - Unique cities and states where customers are located.
  Sales Performance:
  - Total and average order value per customer.
  - Monthly and yearly sales trends.
  - Product category-wise revenue and contribution percentages.
  Order Metrics:
  - Number of orders by month/year.
  - Average number of products per order grouped by customer city.
  Customer Behavior:
  - Top 3 customers by spending per year.
  - Retention rate analysis (repeat purchases within 6 months).
  Seller Analysis:
  - Total revenue generated per seller and seller ranking.
  Time Series Insights:
  - Moving average of order values per customer.
  - Cumulative sales trends across months and years.

# Tools & Technologies
  - Python: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, MySQL connector
  - SQL: Joins, Aggregations, CTEs, Window Functions
  - Database: MySQL

# Visualizations
  - Charts were generated using Python libraries to support SQL findings. Bar plots, line plots, and percentage annotations were used to represent key metrics clearly.
